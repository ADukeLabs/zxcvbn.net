zxcvbn.net
==========


This is a .net port of the zxcvbn.js library.

The lets you use the same password validation on the client side as well as server side.

The zxcvbn password checker is not based on how many symbols, numbers etc you have in a password but on the real world entropy. In other words it takes into account dictionary atacks, common substutions (l33t speek) no work keynord patterns etc.


Entropy is measured in bits, and relates to the number of brute force atempts a hacker would need to try to find your password.
